<p><a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjAWSry">Just take me to the pictures, please</a></p>
<p>Roger, Paul and I set out to complete the Clark Range Traverse section hike of the Yosemite High Route from Andrew Skurka&#39;s <a href="https://andrewskurka.com/product/yosemite-high-route-guide/">Yosemite High Route Guide</a>. We planned 4 days to complete the ~40 miles/~13k elevation gain/loss.</p>
<p>Things got messy right out of the gate.  Staying in Camp 4 the night before our trip we were assigned the site adjacent to the restroom with an obnoxiously loud squeaking door and lights that stayed on all night due to traffic.  On top of that, in the morning Paul told us that his sleeping pad had a hole in it and needed to be patched before we could get started.  It turned out the hole was the side seam coming apart and we couldn&#39;t patch it.  So our nice 6:30am start was now delayed until at least 8:30am so we could wait for the store to open and buy a new sleeping pad.  Roger took off for the trailhead at 7:30am while Paul and I waited outside the store in Curry Village.</p>
<p>Freshly equipped with a new Nemo Tensor, Paul and I finally left the Happy Isles trailhead parking around 9:00am. We were disappointed to see that the Mist Trail was closed M-F for trail work, which the ranger who issued our permit neglected to tell us the day before.  We continued up the JMT until it met the Illilouette Creek trail and caught up with Roger shortly after that. Shortly after the trail junction with the Panorama Trail, we saw a brown colored bear walking up the trail in front of us.  It quickly dipped off into the brush, leaving the trail to us.</p>

<p>The trail continues through mostly manzanita scrub as it wraps around the granite dome of Mount Starr King.</p>

<p>After leaving Red Creek, we were met by a sea of burned trees and our first views of the Clark Range.

<p>The fire damage lasted all the way up Illilouette Creek until around 7800&#39;.  Our plans for camping on this trip were very fluid,
opting to try to get as far as possible each day.  For this first day, we thought our most likely spot would be along Illilouette Creek between about 7300&#39;-7600&#39; but this area was dense with dead trees, so we pushed on to a wide open spot with camping on slabs just below 7900&#39;.<br>Paul and I arrived right around 4:50pm after 13.8 miles (according to my inReach, but there are some anomalies in this track due to the steep walls surrounding the Mist Trail). 
Roger arrived about 30 minutes later, having to push further than we&#39;d planned because of the lack of camping options. </p>

<p>In the morning we got off to a good start, hitting the trail at 6:45am only 15 minutes later than planned.
For a group that historically has trouble getting on the trail before 9:00am this was a huge win with the short days of late September. The upper, unburned, parts of Illilouette Creek were gorgeous in the early morning light.</p>
<p><img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2011.jpeg" alt="Early morning on Illilouette Creek"></p>
<p>After a stop for breakfast at around 7:50am and 8500&#39;, we continued on to Lower Ottoway Lake where we finally hit the alpine environment that we had been craving.  </p>
<p><img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2012.jpeg" alt="Lower Ottoway Lake"></p>
<p>Paul and I arrived at noon, enjoyed a little lunch, soaked our feet in the cool water and hung out waiting for Roger.
When Roger arrived, he dropped a bombshell: He wouldn&#39;t be continuing on the trip.  He was struggling too much, especially on the uphill, and he didn&#39;t feel like he was recovering.  The gorgeous surroundings of Lower Ottoway Lake were perfect, he would spend the night there then head back the next day on a very long (but downhill) hike to the camp at Little Yosemite Valley where we could reunite for dinner if all went well for Paul and I.  </p>
<p>I hated this idea and would have preferred the whole group stay together, but I was confident Roger would be fine on his own and was eventually convinced by the others to go on with Paul and do the traverse.  We&#39;d keep in touch via inReach and radio when possible.</p>
<p>With that, at about 1:30pm Paul and I headed out to Red Peak Pass.  There was a small section of the trail on the South side that was still blocked by snow, but it was easy to bypass. The view gradually improved as we climbed, exposing range after range to the South as we rose above the west ridge of Merced Peak.</p>
<p><img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2013.jpeg" alt="Looking South from Red Peak Pass"></p>
<p>As we stepped over the top at 3:00pm the view to the North unfolded, revealing the incredible skyline we&#39;d be enjoying while we traversed the Clark Range.</p>
<p><img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2015.jpeg" alt="Looking North from Red Peak Pass"></p>
<p>We were surprised to see the Minarets, Ritter, Banner and even Mammoth Mountain! </p>
<p><img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2016.jpeg" alt="View from Red Peak Pass"></p>
<p>As the ranger had told us when we picked up our permit, we had to navigate a few snow patches on the way down the South side of Red Peak Pass.</p>
<p><img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2017.jpeg" alt="Navigating snow patches"></p>
<p>We left the trail at around 10,500&#39; to traverse around a few tarns and climb up to the bigger tarn below the pass that would really kick off the adventure.  We left the trail at 10,500&#39; like the guide says, however the marker on the mapset shows you going further down the trail before leaving.  Our route worked great, and I&#39;d suggest going that way.</p>
<p>At the larger tarn, we filled up water and discussed our options.  It was 4:30pm once we&#39;d filled water and eaten a snack. We had 500&#39; to climb on easy slabs, 30 minutes, then a long descent to Adair Lake where we hoped to camp.  There are a few tarns along the way where we could camp, or we could fill up more water for a dry camp, or we could stay here at the tarn and make a big push on day 3.  We opted for the latter option, and it turned out to be quite fortuitous because the view from this tarn at sunset was absolutely incredible.</p>

<p>We had a few struggles the next morning getting out of camp, but eventually got moving around 7:15am after a beautiful sunrise we headed up the slabs.</p>

<img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2028.jpeg" alt="Early morning look at Red Peak Pass"></p>
<p>Looking down the North side of this first off-trail pass we saw a large talus slope with some cliff bands directly below us.</p>
<p><img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2029.jpeg" alt="Looking down"></p>
<p>After a little routefinding we realized that the cliffs were protecting snow banks, and there was no snow off to our left. We headed left, and were able to descend the talus down to the first little tarn.</p>

<img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2030.jpeg" alt="Tarn with ice layer"></p>
<p>We prepared some breakfast in the sun before heading down to the next set of tarns and the gullies that lead to Adair Lake.</p>
<p><img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2031.jpeg" alt="Breakfast!">
<img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2033.jpeg" alt="Approaching the gullies"></p>
<p>The gullies presented a bit more of a challenge than we&#39;d expected due to large amounts of snow filling them.</p>

<img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2037.jpeg" alt="More Gullies"></p>
<p>We did some easy rock climbing, careful snow walking, bushwhacking and talus hopping to reach Adair Lake where we were finally able to see Lemonade Pass which sounded horrible in the guide.  We ate some snacks, got some water and headed out at 11:00am.</p>
<p><img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2038.jpeg" alt="Adair Lake">
<img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2039.jpeg" alt="Lemonade Pass"></p>
<p>This pass was every bit as fun as the guide made it sound. A long, steep slope full of loose dirt and rocks on the South side reveals an even steeper and equally loose route down the North side with the added bonus of a cliff band waiting directly beneath. Thankfully the North side was quite a bit shorter and we were down, crossing a snowfield and doing a quick talus climb up to a small tarn in time for lunch at 1:00pm.</p>

<img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2041.jpeg" alt="Lemonade Pass - North Side from below"></p>
<p>The next section of the route was very pleasant after dealing with large talus, snowy gullies, bushwhacking, and the steep loose dirt and rock.  A nice traverse across gorgeous clean slabs, easy walking all the way to the lake below Mt Clark.</p>

<img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2046.jpeg" alt="End of the Slab walking"></p>
<p>After some snacks, filling water, a little shuteye, and figuring out the next section of the route we got going again at 2:30pm to bag Quartzite Peak. The little tarn on the map above Obelisk lake was still covered in snow and held a bunch of fallen trees that we assume was avalanche debris.</p>

<img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2052.jpeg" alt="Avalanche Debris in a snow pile"></p>
<p>The climb up to the ridge leading to Quartzite Peak was straightforward.  More loose dirt and rocks, but not as steep, difficult or long as Lemonade Pass.  We wondered about how the ridge ended up covered in talus at the top while we worked our way towards the saddle below the peak.</p>
<p><img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2054.jpeg" alt="Talus on top of the ridge"></p>
<p>The guide really hypes up the view from Quartzite Peak and it absolutely lived up to the hype.</p>

<img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2056.jpeg" alt="View from Quartzite Peak"></p>
<p>This was also the point where we could celebrate being done with all of the significant uphill on this hike! </p>
<p>We decided we&#39;d hike down until 5:30pm, then find a place to camp.  After the last two nights on rock Paul made me promise that we&#39;d find something softer to sleep on.  We worked our way down to about 9600&#39;, found a really nice spot in the trees and spent our last night on the trail.  We heard from Roger on the inReach that he successfully made it to Little Yosemite Valley after enjoying a nice long rest at the top of the beautiful Nevada Falls.</p>
<p>In the morning we set out around 7:10am to finish the off-trail section of this route and then work our way back to Yosemite Valley on the trail.</p>
<p>The first parts of this descent were easy, just as described in the guide book.  Slabs, easy forest walking, more slabs all with great views.</p>
<p><img src="/img/yhr/yhr%20-%2062.jpeg" alt="Slabs!">

<p>At the bench at 7700&#39; things got tricky.  Moving through forest, following a bearing towards the final slab descent, running into ledges and lots of fallen trees.  Eventually we found our way to the slabs and started down. Shortly we discovered why this section was labeled as &quot;<em><strong>Mostly</strong></em> Slabs&quot;.  It&#39;s slabs mixed with horrendous bushwhacking to avoid some cliffy sections.  This was the least pleasant part of the whole route, but we did eventually get through it. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a better way through this section, but we traversed back and forth looking for other options and didn&#39;t find anything better.</p>

<p>Once back on the trail, we made some coffee and ate a light breakfast before beginning the easy walk all the way back to Happy Isles.  The upper section of this trail especially is really beautiful, but it&#39;s really nice all the way down. We arrived at our car at 2:30pm.  Roger went down the Mist Trail which was closed at Vernal Falls until 3:00pm, so he hung out and met us at 4:00pm at the car ready for the long ride home.  What a trip.  The route through the Clark Range is incredible! </p>
