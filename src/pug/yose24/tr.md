### Getting Ready for the Hike

After picking up our permits, we headed out of the park to a walk-in campground called Sawmill near Saddlebag Lake.  I didn't have any particularly high expectations, but we ended up with a beautiful site overlooking Lee Vining Creek and the always impressive Mt. Conness towering in the distance.

From the end of the campground was a quick walk up to an old research site in the Harvey Monroe Hall Natural Area.

The actual research site has seen better days though.

### Day 1 - Dana Meadow to Lost Lakes

We got an early start the next morning, getting to the Mono/Parker Pass Trailhead around 6:40am and headed through Dana Meadow and some nice forested areas on our way towards Spillway Lake.

![Creek running through a meadow with peaks in the background](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%209.jpeg)

After stopping for breakfast along the trail, we reached Spillway Lake around 9:20am and took a moment to reflect on the path so far.

![Paul looking back](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2010.jpeg)

The trail ends at Spillway Lake, so we started to make our way up the lake's inlet stream towards Helen Lake above.

![Climbing towards Helen Lake](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2011.jpeg)

When we reached Helen Lake, we took a moment to marvel at the incredible high elevation meadow that runs from Parker Pass to Spillway Lake.

![High Elevation Meadow Panorama](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2012.jpeg)

From Helen Lake, we set off to cross the Kuna Crest near the saddle in the middle of this picture.

![Helen Lake and Kuna Crest](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2013.jpeg)

As we walked around Helen Lake, we were called by the siren song of easy slab walking and started heading up too soon.  At around 11,400 feet we realized we needed to head to our left to hit the saddle we were aiming for.  Thankfully, there was a very easy traverse path at that elevation that led right into a straightfoward line through the talus. This really worked out great, even if we were "off route".

![In the talus above Helen Lake](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2014.jpeg)
![Nearing the top of the crest](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2015.jpeg)

Once over the top of the crest, we were treated to incredible views over Lyell Canyon to the Cathedral Range and beyond.

![Over Lyell Canyon](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2016.jpeg)
![Over Lyell Canyon](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2017.jpeg)

Our plan was to go down and around a ridge that would take us to Lake 11516, the first camping option on the hike.  It was still early, around 12:30pm after eating lunch on top of the crest.  We quickly realized that crossing the ridge up high wasn't going to work so we went lower on the ridge and found a scramble up and over which let us finally see Lost Lakes Pass.

![A little scrambling](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2019.jpeg)
![Lost Lakes Pass](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2020.jpeg)

Crossing the bench to Lost Lakes Pass was reasonably easy, but involved a lot of little ups and downs and looking for a decent path through the rocky terrain full of small cliffs.

There was a lot of beauty up here as we crossed several creeks, meadows and small lakes on our way to the pass.

![Creek and meadow](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2021.jpeg)
![Small lakes](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2022.jpeg)
![Meadows](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2023.jpeg)

Climbing Lost Lakes Pass was easy enough, it was a few hundred feet of cliffs and ledges leading to our first views of Banner and Ritter along with the incredible Lost Lakes valley.

![Lost Lakes Valley](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2024.jpeg)

We made our way down to find a camp near the trees on the left side of the lake, hoping to find some shelter from the wind rushing up the valley.  

![Looking back up at the pass from below](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2026.jpeg)

We arrived in camp really early, around 3:3opm, but the hike down from Lost Lakes Pass had taken it's toll on Paul's IT band and he was ready to rest.  We had a surprise brief rain shower that lasted for about an hour and prompted me to set up my tarp for some quick shelter.  I kept it up just in case so I wouldn't get rained on in the middle of the night.  We didn't see any more rain, but we were treated to some incredible alpenglow on Blacktop Peak and the Koip Crest.

### Day 2 - Lost Lakes to Thousand Island Lake

Paul was still struggling a bit in the morning, so we had breakfast in camp and talked through our options.  We decided the easiest way out if things were really bad was likely over Donohue Pass and through Lyell Canyon, so we would continue on this morning on our planned route and re-assess at the JMT.

I was curious about this next section, it looked great on the maps and aerial photography, but I hadn't been there and hadn't seen any trip reports covering this section over to the Marie Lakes trail.  

The first thing we discovered was some really nice flat slabby ground and less wind a little lower in the valley, closer to the lower lake.

![Near the nicer camp sites](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2029.jpeg)
![View from the Lower Lake](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2030.jpeg)

This gave way to a magnificent panoramic view as we reached the edge of the valley where we filled up water at the outlet stream.

![Magnificent Panorama](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2031.jpeg)

We knew we needed to climb down around 200 feet to get around a large rock outcropping, and thankfully this ended up being very easy and mostly walking down granite slabs.

![Coming down from Lost Lakes](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2032.jpeg)

After decending the 200 feet and traversing around the corner we found some cliffy areas that we decided to walk around and found our way to a number of small lakes surrounded by slabs and grassland in the flats below Donohue Peak.

![Lake below Donohue Peak](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2033.jpeg)

We also crossed a stream with incredibly clear blue water.

![Pretty Stream](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2034.jpeg)

When we reached the JMT, we had a great view of what we'd just crossed.  

![View back along our path to Lost Lakes Valley](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2035.jpeg)

We laid out all of our maps and talked through options.  
 * Option 1 - Continue to Marie Lakes, cross the Ritter Range at North Clinch Pass, and traverse to Lake Catherine. 
 * Option 2 - Marie Lakes to Davis Lakes via Marie Pass, possibly on to Thousand Island Lake.  
 * Option 3 - JMT to Thousand Island Lake
 * Option 4 - Donohue Pass to Tuolumne Meadows

 At this point, Paul was feeling good after a few easy miles and we decided to push on for Option 1, knowing we had other options still in our back pocket.  We set off cross country towards the basin below Marie Lakes, the headwaters of Rush Creek.

 The climb up was easy and we were treated to an incredible view of the Ritter Range and Rush Creek Headwaters.

 ![Ritter Range, Rush Creek Headwaters](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2036.jpeg)

 The valley below Marie Lakes was striking, so much water flowing through green meadows blanketed with wildflowers.

 ![Rush Creek](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2037.jpeg)
 ![Indian Paintbrush near Rush Creek](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2038.jpeg)

 ![Idyllic views of the valley](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2040.jpeg)

While the views were remarkable, the descent had once again taken its toll on Paul's hip. We decided Marie Lakes was out of the picture for this trip, and our best bet was to head down to the JMT on the Marie Lakes trail and make our way to Thousand Island lake.  It was right around noon, so we stopped first for a lovely lunch in the valley.

![Lunch below Marie Lakes](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2041.jpeg)

After lunch, we found our way to the Marie Lakes trail and started the long, hot, dusty walk on the JMT to Thousand Island Lake.  (Ok, it's not that long, but it was hot and dusty and it FELT long being on such a high traffic trail for so long!)

We ran across a beautiful flower filled meadow just below Island Pass, and shortly after got our first views of Thousand Island Lake.  

![Meadow below Island Pass](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2042.jpeg)

We were both surprised just how far it was from Island Pass to the lake, but we hadn't really researched this at all since it wasn't on our planned route.

We walked around the lake and eventually found a really nice camp site that wasn't close to anyone else and gave us a great view of Banner and the lake.

![View from Camp](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2043.jpeg)

I've seen many pictures of Thousand Island Lake before and knew that it's a highlight worthy location.  It's part of the reason we were in the area, although we'd planned this as an early morning drive-by and not a camp site.  I wanted to avoid camping here because of the number of people from the JMT, but it turned out that with good site selection this was a really magnificent place to spend the night.  We got incredible views of the lake, moon and Banner as we watched the sunset and ate dinner.

### Day 3 - Thousand Island Lake over Koip Peak Pass

Sunrise over the lake wasn't too bad either!

![Sunrise on Banner and Thousand Island Lake](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2047.jpeg)

The best part, an easier day and good night sleep seemed to be just what Paul's hip needed.  We hit the trail in the morning feeling great.

![Mirror shot of Banner and Thousand Island Lake](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2048.jpeg)

![Paul on the PCT leaving Thousand Island Lake](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2049.jpeg)

A quick jaunt on the PCT took us to our next short off-trail excursion.  A link up from the PCT to Sullivan Lake and down to Rush Creek near Gem Lake.  This was a very nice easy hike up a gentle slope into some cliffy rock at the ridge.  This turned out to be a great place for a nice breakfast before heading into the drainage that leads to Sullivan Lake.

![Paul on the ridge above Sullivan Lake](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2051.jpeg)

![Paul checking the maps at breakfast](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2053.jpeg)

The walk down to Rush Creek was simple enough, starting out by hopping drainages anytime it got a bit steep, then following gentle hillside down to the trail.  At the bottom we found the Rush Creek Footbridge.

![Paul on the Rush Creek Footbridge](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2054.jpeg)

The hike up from Gem Lake to Gem Pass was pretty uneventful other than trying to find a good spot to get water.  When we reached Gem Pass, the world opened up around us: views down to Highway 395, June and Mammoth Mountains, and the deep valley holding the Alger Lakes.

![Gem Pass](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2055.jpeg)

We arrived at Alger Lakes around noon.  We'd planned to camp here, but it was early so we ate some lunch and decided to keep moving to the other side of Koip Peak Pass.

![Alger Lakes](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2057.jpeg)

Koip Peak Pass was quite intimidating from below.  A barren red expanse of rocks rising 1700 feet above Alger Lakes.  When we started up, there was actually a surprising amount of plant life all the way to top, including this pop of color just before the real climb started.

![FLowers at the base of Koip Peak Pass](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2058.jpeg)

We also got a view of the upper Alger Lakes with their glacial silt coloring.

![Upper Alger Lake](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2059.jpeg)

The views to the south from the pass were incredible.

![Looking South from near the top of Koip Peak Pass](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2060.jpeg)
![Paul topping out on Koip Peak Pass](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2061.jpeg)

At the top of the pass, we both felt good and it was still fairly early at 2:40pm so we decided to take a quick run up Koip Peak and over to Kuna Peak.  The views from the top of Koip were spectacular!

Mt Conness to the North, Mono Lake, huge swathes of the Sierra in every direction.

![Koip Peak looking North](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2062.jpeg)
![Koip Peak looking South](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2064.jpeg)
![Mono Lake from Koip Peak](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2065.jpeg)
![Kuna glacier from Koip Peak](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2068.jpeg)
![Panorama from Koip Peak](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2063.jpeg)

Legs were starting to get tired at this point, so we skipped Kuna Peak and headed back down to the pass.  On the way down, and for a good chunk of the trail down from the pass, Mono Lake looked like you could almost reach out and touch it.

![Mono Lake near Koip Peak Pass](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2070.jpeg)

We got a nice view of Parker Pass, which we'd cross tomorrow morning, and the small lake we were going to stay at tonight.

![Parker Pass](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2071.jpeg)

This side of Koip Peak Pass was really quite impressive!  A huge traverse around Parker Peak above a cliff band to a gentler slope with dramatic switchbacks that end at a sharp ridge with quite a bit of exposure.

![Heading down Koip Peak Pass](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2072.jpeg)

Down at the base of the pass we crossed a beautiful cascade before reaching the lake.

![Cascade below Koip Peak Pass](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2073.jpeg)

This valley is so gentle and wide open, until you get near the edge where it drops precipitously down towards the 395.

![Parker Valley drop off](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2074.jpeg)

We got to our camp a little before 5:30 and decided we'd head out as soon as we woke up in the morning and eat breakfast on the trail.

### Day 4 - Parker Pass to Dana Meadow

The first few miles of the hike out were across the enchanting meadow that had captured our attention back on Day 1 as we crossed the Kuna Crest.  Quite beatiful to see this sprawling grassland at 11,000 feet punctuated by rocky peaks.

![Peaks near Parker Pass](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2076.jpeg)
![Looking back down Parker Pass](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2077.jpeg)
![Grassland at 11,000'](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2078.jpeg)

We had a nice view back towards Helen Lake and the Kuna Crest.

![Kuna Crest from Parker Pass area](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2079.jpeg)

The original plan for this trip came when I found permits available for Bloody Canyon, before I could get the permit for Mono/Parker Pass in Yosemite.  We got a little bit of a look towards Bloody Canyon as we crossed Mono Pass.

![Mono Pass/Bloody Canyon](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2080.jpeg)

We thought about stopping but just decided to keep on moving this morning.

![Walk back to the car](/img/yose24/yose24%20-%2081.jpeg)

We got to the car a little before 9:30am, had a cup of coffee in the parking lot and then headed home.  What a great adventure, lots of varied beautiful terrain and wonderful company!
